inputs: 
calls:

		outputs: release_version, release_url
		steps:
			get release values:
				set repoName: last value after splitting on '/'
					env.REPO_NAME
				set relVersion: last value after splitting on '-' of target pr branch #e.g. release-1.0.0, relVersion = 1.0.0
					env.RELEASE_VERSION
				set isPreRelease: true if target pr branch starts with 'release-' and the event is an opened or synchronized pr
					env.IS_PRE_RELEASE

			existing-version (Check for existing version tags)
				set env.GITHUB_TOKEN from secrets
				set VERSION_NUMBER from env.RELEASE_VERSION from previous step
				set tagsList: using git.listMatchingRefs (prop label 'tags' of current repo/owner context)
(?????)	set env.VERSION_NUMBER from process.env (?????) - I think this is done so that it can be used in a variable later
				set tags (array): from tagsList, reversed
				set env.MANUAL_VERSION: if no tags exist or latest tag does not start with env.VERSION_NUMBER

			merged-pull-request (checks for merged pull request)
				if: event=push
					set pulls (array) from pulls.list where state=closed
# This block needs work
#  // get the state of the latest pull request for this repo
#  const state = pulls.data[0].state;
#  const mergeSHA = pulls.data[0].merge_commit_sha;
#  const IS_RELEASE = (state == 'closed') && (mergeSHA == context.sha);
					set state: state of latest pulls data (I think this will always be closed based on previous pull definition)
					set mergeSHA: merge_commit_sha of latest pulls data
					set IS_RELEASE: mergeSHA is the same as the current run sha
					export IS_RELEASE variable into env.IS_RELEASE
