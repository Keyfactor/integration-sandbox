### Configuring for PAM Usage
#### In Hashicorp Vault
When configuring the Hashicorp Vault for use as a PAM Provider with Keyfactor, you will need to set up and configure the `kv` functionality in Vault. You will need an API Key that has the right permissions. The default `secret` location can be used, or another location.

After adding a secret object to `kv` with a key and value, you can use the object's name (the "KV Secret Name") and the secret's key (the "KV Secret Key") to retrieve credentials from the Hashicorp Vault as a PAM Provider.
